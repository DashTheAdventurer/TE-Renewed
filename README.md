# Technical Enchant+
Technical Enchant+ is a Minecraft datapack originally created by Hardel (original link [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/enchant-datapack-1-13/)). I updated it adding new features, mechanics & updating it to the latest Minecraft versions.

At its current state, TE+ isn't the same as the original and some of the most important features include:

- 52 custom enchantments & 5 custom curses for any piece of armor, tool & weapon
- A custom enchanting system with Minecraft's vanilla enchanting table
- A custom Anvil,  named the Technical Anvil, to merge custom enchanted books and items
- Extract custom enchantments from items using the Technical Anvil
- Many customizable options using admin commands
- Compatibility with modded items by using TE+ Complements
- More custom enchantments using TE+ Addons
- Extra mechanics using TE+ Extensions including:
    - Allow mobs to use TE+ enchantments
    - Certain mobs can spawn with TE+ enchants
    - Find custom enchantments in any vanilla structure
    - (Almost) any mob can spawn with custom enchanted books as a drop
    - Exceed vanilla enchants from 20 vanilla enchantments


# Getting started
When you place your first enchanting table you will get an advancement; you should follow the steps that are displayed there. Try getting a guide book (which supports other languages if you have the resource pack installed). You can also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Frektip/Technical-Enchant-Renewed/wiki) to get more detailed information about the datapack.

# Useful commands

`/function enchantplus:config`: Change the TE+ settings (very important for server owners)

`/function enchantplus:give/all`: Obtain a barrel with all TE+ items

`/function #enchantplus:uninstall`: Uninstall the datapack and its branches (addons, extensions & complements)

`/function enchantplus:heldenchant/set/<enchantment>`: Enchant any held item with applicable TE+ enchantments
