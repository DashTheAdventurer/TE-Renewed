Technical Enchant +

-----New World----

When you are creating a new world go to datapacks and drag TE+ zip file into your world. Then move 
the datapack into the "selected" section.

Create your new world and enjoy! :)

If for whatever reason that doesn´t work, type "/reload" or "datapack enable [name]" to enshure you
installed correctly the datapack.


---- Existing world----

Go to your world´s folder, then go to datapacks and drag the zip file there. Then type "/reload" to
fully implement TE+ datapack into your world

If you are comming from a version previous to 6.1, you should unequip and equip back your items, because
I change the syntax of how every echantment is detected in the datapack. Don't worry I also implement a 
system that automatically update your items (a message will tell you when this happens). 


---- Update datapack version -----

If you had TE+ previously installed, use the uninstall command function first (/function enchantplus:uninstall),
after that you can follow the steps as mentioned above to correctly install the datapack into your world.

#### Potential Issues ######

-When there are other datapacks or mods that aren´t compatible with TE+
-When you use custom clients. Please check out if the datapack works with vanilla client, then you can
confirm if the client you´re using is the cause of the problem
-When you are using outdated minecraft versions duh! TE+ currently supports 1.17+ ; 1.18+ and 1.19+
