Technical Enchant +

-----New World----

When you are creating a new world go to datapacks and drag TE+ zip file into your world. Then move 
the datapack into the "selected" section.

Create your new world and enjoy! :)

If for whatever reason that doesn't work, type "/reload" or "datapack enable [name]" to enshure you
installed correctly the datapack.


---- Existing world----

Go to your world's folder, then go to datapacks and drag the zip file there. Then type "/reload" to
fully implement TE+ datapack into your world

Keep in mind that the datapack has changed a lot, so in certain cases it would be better
for you to Start a new world or disenchant all your items and enchant them again with the
newest version. This is due to heavy changes into the nbt syntax, Lore build or just the main
code in general. The most noticable changes are in v6.1 and v7.3 


---- Update datapack version -----

If you had TE+ previously installed, use the uninstall command function first (/function #enchantplus:uninstall),
after that you can follow the steps as mentioned above to correctly install the datapack into your world.

If you used Addons or Complements, you should also install the latest version of them because in
certain cases they will stop working due to heavy changes in the base code.

#### Potential Issues ######

-When there are other datapacks or mods that aren't compatible with TE+, mainly something that
 affects the enchanting table or vanilla enchantments in general.

-When you use custom clients. Please check out if the datapack works with vanilla client, then you
 can confirm if the client you're using is the cause of the problem.

-When you are using outdated minecraft versions duh! TE+ currently supports 1.17+ ; 1.18+ and 1.19+
 in some cases the latest TE+ version won't be available for really old Minecraft versions.
